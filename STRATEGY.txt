UNTIL YOU ARE SURE ITS WROKING RIGHT USE THE TINY FILES

USE THE TINY JUMBLES FILE :
atc
otsp
gdo
atr
arpt
grof
sygols

READ IT INTO a TREESET


USE TINY DICTIONARY FILE 
act
cat
tac
dog
god
post
pots
stop
spot
tops
opts
rat
tar
art
trap
tarp
part
flog
golf
frog
gorp
glossy

READ IT INTO A TreeMap<String,TreeSet<String>> like this

using a BufferedReader since the dictionary words are one word per line:

for each word/line read in from the dictionary file do this 
	call dict word dWord make canonical copy named dCanon
	if dCanon not yet in the keys of the map then
		put( dCanon, new empty TreeSet )
	add the dWord to the TreeSet associated with the dCanon key
	(just like we did with PACS)
end loop

YOU HAVE JUST BUILT THe LOOKUP TABLE NOW PROCESS THe JUMBLES TREESET

for each word in the jumbles TreeSet
	print the jWord
	make a canoncal copy of jWord call it jCanon
	if jCanon is contained in the keys of the map
	then loop thru the TreeSet associated with that jCanon key
	printing a space followed by the next word - use enhanced for loop
	(just like we did with PACS)

	print a newline 
end loop 

YOU ARE DONE!
